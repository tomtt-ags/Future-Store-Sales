# therfore past data is useful for predicting future data
# to test we can use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, null hypothesis is that the data is not stationary
# if p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the data is stationary
# we compare p value with test 0.05 or test statistic with critical values, both used for same purpose
# if p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that the data is stationary

#### Theoretical Concept: SARIMA
# Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is an extension of ARIMA that explicitly models the seasonal component.

# It is written as SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, m), where:
# - `(p, d, q)` are the non-seasonal parameters:
#     - p (non-seasonal AR order): The number of non-seasonal lagged observations included in the model.
#     - d (non-seasonal differencing order): The number of times the data is differenced to remove non-seasonal trend.
#     - q (non-seasonal MA order): The number of non-seasonal lagged forecast errors included in the model.

# - `(P, D, Q, m)` are the seasonal parameters:
#     - P (seasonal AR order): The number of seasonal lagged observations included in the model.
#     - D (seasonal differencing order): The number of times the data is differenced seasonally to remove seasonal trend.
#     - Q (seasonal MA order): The number of seasonal lagged forecast errors included in the model.
#     - m (number of periods in a season):The number of time steps for a single seasonal period (e.g., `m=12` for monthly data with an annual seasonality, `m=4` for quarterly data).

# 1) Load and prepare the monthly time series without dropping months
df = pd.read_csv('21-Days-21-Projects-Dataset/Datasets/airline_passenger_timeseries.csv')
# Expecting columns: ['Month', 'Passengers'] (classic airline dataset format)

### Step 9: Conclusion

# In this project, I built a complete time series forecasting pipeline.

# Key Steps Undertaken:
# 1.  Decomposed the time series to identify its underlying trend and strong yearly seasonality.
# 2.  Confirmed non-stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
# 3.  Transformed the data using log transforms and differencing to achieve stationarity, a prerequisite for ARIMA modeling.
# 4.  Used ACF/PACF plots to identify the initial parameters for our model.
# 5.  Built a baseline ARIMA model which captured the trend but failed to model the seasonality.
# 6.  Built an advanced SARIMA model that successfully captured both trend and seasonality, resulting in a much more accurate forecast.
# 7.  Evaluated the final model on the original scale using RMSE.

# This project clearly demonstrates the importance of identifying and specifically modeling seasonality for accurate time series forecasting.
